    <h1 class="bebas-neue-regular"> ENDLESS SUMMER</h1>
    <h2 class="lato-regular">By Mia Layne 3948647</h2>
    <p class="lato-bold"> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">
        The summery colour palette immediately grabbed my attention making me feel like I was on the beach and the sun was hitting my face. The music made me feel relaxed instantly and truly immersed in the experience. Also on a laptop having to resize the screen to be portrait orientation was engaging from the start. Not only resizing but as you resized the sun rose in the background which takes the user to the launch page. The fading white text on the blue gradient reminded me of waves crashing on the shore.  The gradient background also has a pattern in it which is subtle but adds to the summer aesthetic. Once going through the instructions and getting to the start of the experience I found the scrolling feature interesting and clever as it represents where the sun is relative to the times of day at the bottom of the screen. 
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold"> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">Once landing on the first screen I used my mouse to explore the scene. Going up and down left to right to see what was hiding outside of the portrait aspect ratio. I also noticed a cat had a glowing outline, which I clicked to show in writing what the cat was thinking. I scrolled the dial to move to the different times of the day or scenes. Once I had scrolled onto the second page or 9 am I clicked the three dots to discover the parents being grateful their children are well behaved. Scrolling to the pool there is a lady sitting with a cat on one side and a mobile phone on the other. Once pressed the phone starts playing music which the lady dances to. Scrolling to the lady in the outdoor shower you can hear the water running, the next scroll is a lady gardening. Scrolling to the tennis match while viewing this experience of a phone you could mimic your head turning while watching a tennis match in person when you moved the phone side to side. After that scrolling through the next few until the ice cream truck scene, there was another interactive element a lizard that’s on the side of the ice cream truck which runs away once clicked. Jumping to the 2:30 pm time slot the lifeguard’s radio once pressed made a noise and following that a car made an unlock noise and a cricket ran away. </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">The scene I engaged with the most was the tennis court scene as the blue tennis court had the same textured look as the sky in the introduction scenes making it look like the characters were playing tennis in a pool. I liked the contrast between the blue court and the pink surrounding area as well as the decorations around the court. The sound from the players also made their actions seem true to tennis. The players are also dressed in white which contrasts well with everything in the frame as everything besides their outfits is brightly coloured. 
    </p>

    <p class="lato-bold">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">Scrolling between each scene was the most common action along with clicking and dragging on the trackpad to look around. In every scene, there are three dots on the screen that zoom in on a particular character or highlight an object in the frame. For example, there is a scene that has a Jeep in the frame and if clicked the car unlocks making the car lights flicker and noise occurs. </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">On one of the opening pages, it indicates the website is unveiling the RM 07-01 coloured ceramics. Knowing the brand told me it was a series of watches that they were promoting through this experience.</p>
    <p class="lato-bold">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">If I didn't know outside of the experience that the brand was a watch company I would have believed right up until the end it was promoting ceramics as that is disclosed early on. The last page takes you to an external page that showcases the watches. So if I didn’t have prior knowledge of the brand I don’t think it was communicated effectively to the audience. However, after looking at the experience again each scene has a time on screen and to move between scenes you scroll a dial which could imply it’s a watch they are promoting. 
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">It should be interacted with several times as you can pick up things you missed like the glowing items showing additional clips. The first watch-through should be at least 10 - 15 minutes to get an understanding of what it is. Then rewatch after a short break to read all of the poems and to find the interactive elements for 20 to 25 minutes. Then rewatch a day later to see if there is anything else you missed. At the end of the experience, it also gives you a highlight reel allowing you to go back to particular scenes without having to start again. 
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">There are so many interactive elements to discover so it can be watched endlessly to find each thing hidden in the scenes. Every time watching it I find something new and I’ve probably missed some.  At the end of the experience, it also lets you see some scenes out of order which can give new or different insights to the user.
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">The experience refers to music, illustration and animation the most. The three combined are showcased from start to finish of the experience. The same base music is in the experience the whole way through with additional sound effects in each specific scene. The illustrations were from one main perspective however users got to see two sometimes three illustrations/animations as the three dots gave different perspectives of the same scenes from different views.</p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">You should be fully immersed in the experience of watching with headphones in and at a high enough volume to hear each of the different sounds and conversations. Watching it at a high brightness to see all the colours stand out.
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">The experience wants to feel happy and excited this is indicated through the use of warm colours associated with summer and happy times. The music also can make you feel relaxed and the characters in the experience can make users excited to play a sport, go to the beach or even run with their dog.  </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">The screen you can see is not a full-screen image. The browser must be portrait to view the experience but starts landscape. Having to resize the window you are viewing it in to start the experience on a laptop. On a phone, I find the graphics aren’t as clear making it easy to miss the glowing interactive objects.
    </p>
    <p class="lato-bold">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </p>
    <p class="lato-regular">The music is consistent throughout and it is quite relaxing. You don’t get sick of it as it plays the entire time. As well as the colour palette is consistent across the experience which ties everything together nicely. It ties in with the name of the project as well “Endless Summer” The colours can be associated with summer and the use of gradients suggests that it's endless as it doesn’t have an end point. Also, all the scenes are connected so effortlessly and going from one to another you can still see elements of the previous scenes in the next making the storytelling very easy to follow.</p>
